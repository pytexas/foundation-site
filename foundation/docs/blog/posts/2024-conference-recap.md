# PyTexas 2024 Conference

18 years after _PyCamp Texas_, 2024 will go down in history as the biggest PyTexas
Conference yet. Every prior record, from attendance to CFP submissions, was shattered
this year. So let's jump into it.

## What Was New This Year?

### Tutorials 

Tutorials are not new to the PyTexas Conference, but it is the first time we've 
had tutorials since 2017.  Long-time attendee, speaker, and Keynoter 
[Andrew "Pandy" Knight](https://www.pytexas.org/2024/schedule/tutorials/#def-test_my_code_with_pytest) 
and organizer [Mason Egger](https://www.pytexas.org/2024/schedule/tutorials/#def-test_my_code_with_pytest) delivered the tutorials this year. 

We sold 97 tutorial tickets this year, which were an add-on to the main conference.
This ticket gave access to both tutorials. Nearly every ticket holder attended 
at least one tutorial.

The community reaction to tutorials was universally strong and we're excited
to bring tutorials back next year.

## Opportunity Grants
Every year we offer opportunity grants to community members who request assistance
to attend PyTexas. In 2023 we provided $1000 to two members of our community so 
they could attend. This year we were proud to be able to **more than double** the
amount of money we were able to disperse. This year we provided $2500 to five
individuals to attend, all of whom came from under represented communities in tech!

While we weren't able to provide financial assistance to every applicant, we 
were able to provide free virtual tickets to every person who applied for assistance
so they could watch and interact with the conference, regardless of their location.
