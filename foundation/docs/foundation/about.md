# About Us
The PyTexas Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit run by a Texas-based volunteer 
group. We are Python enthusiasts that want to share the programming language 
with the world, starting right here in Texas. We host and support a variety of 
programs that benefit the Python community in Texas, including an annual conference 
and virtual monthly meetup, a virtual community for the Python developers in Texas
and beyond, and various in-person meetups in cities throughout the state.

## History
Founded in 2014, meetup organizers from Houston, Austin, and San Antonio came
together to establish a non-profit organization who's mission would be to 
serve the Python community in Texas. Glen Zangirolami, Jeremy Boyd, and Kevin
Horn were the Foundation's founders and first Board of Directors. In 2022, Mason
Egger was elected as president of the board, taking over for Glen.
