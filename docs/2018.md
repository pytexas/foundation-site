# 2018 PyTexas Conference

The PyTexas Conference decided to move to become a springtime event. PyTexas 2017 
was held in November and the organizers didn't think it was possible to schedule
PyTexas 2018 in early spring so shortly after the 2017 conference. For this reason,
the conference was skipped to allow for a reset year.
